# Move-coffee
Micro-application for keeping the computer in active mode
This happens due to the endless movement of the cursor every 5 seconds.
It will be useful for those who need to leave the computer to perform a long task (for example, batch processing of photogrammetry on weak computers) and be sure that the computer will not go into sleep mode. The application weighs almost nothing, does not require installation and skills to use.
